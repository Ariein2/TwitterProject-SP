# TwitterProject-SP
Analysis of the polarity of tweets associated with multiple trends at different timepoints. The objective is to determine the impact that certain social events can have in the sentiment of the Twitter community.

PROJECT OUTLINE:
  Data extraction: Retrieve tweets associated with a certain topic and timepoint.
  Preprocessing: Remove tweets not belonging to the query search criteria or repeated tweets.
  Sentiment Analysis: Determine the polarity of the tweets.
  Data selection: Combine different datasets and select samples to obtain comparable results.
  Exploratory Analysis: Perform an exploratory analysis of the data.
  One-class SVM: Compare the trends at two different time points to identify the most distinct samples.
  
The example code analyses tweets from two viral trends in 2020 the #BlackLivesMatter movement and the #COVID19 pandemic. Both datasets will be studied at two different time points, before and after the George Floyd's death. To observe how such a significant and politicised event affected the sentiment in the tweets related to both trends. An independent dataset will be used as a control, which includes tweets containing the #kitten or #pet.
